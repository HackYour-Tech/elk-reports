# elk-reports

This repo contains a collection of reports generated from the HackYour.tech network. 

These report are automatically generated and pushed to GitHub every Monday, at roughly 9am UTC. Their data is an accumulation of data retrieved from our ELK stack, which is populated from honeypots we have deployed.

The main reason for these reports is for us to get some insight into the type of data threat actors/bots/skids are using against exposed services.
